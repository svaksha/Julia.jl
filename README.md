# INDEX
For Base packages, check if the package you seek is listed in the [built-in package manager](https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl) on github, or check METADATA for [registered Julia packages](http://pkg.julialang.org/), then use the built-in package manager to install it after checking the requirements for respective versions and dont forget the Easter eggs! 
For package creators, here is a [sample Julia package](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl) model. The latest interesting package statistics are available at the [Julia Package Ecosystem Pulse](http://pkg.julialang.org/pulse.html) webpage which mirrors the current core development on [github](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pulse).

**DISCLAIMER :** As a new language in the scientific computing scene it is frequently in a state of flux due to the addition of new libraries, resulting in frequent changes and page reordering. Since the **Julia.jl** repo only provides a list (of links) of Julia packages out in the wild, it should not be considered an endorsment of any particular package for software quality, technical features, coding style/organization, etc...

# CONTRIBUTE
[Contributions](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/graphs/contributors) to `Julia.jl` are welcome in the form of pull requests (PR). Here are some guidelines and tips on how to submit a Bug Report (BR) and/or [PR](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/pulls):

## Guidelines
The Julia community has [ethical guidelines](http://julialang.org/community/standards/) aimed at respecting Copyright, Licenses and attribution standards which you are requested to follow while submitting materials to be listed. Additionally, if you find any material (or code repos) that violates these ethical standards, please file a bug report for their removal from `Julia.jl`.

## BugReport-PullRequest
1. Add your link as per the top-level Category page within the topic sub-section(s), in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) in the markdown files.
2. For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report (BR), or make the necessary changes and submit a PR. Both are welcome. Please submit separate PR's for each link or change added.
3. For Documentation and cookbooks, check if it matches the categories listed, else, list it on the [Resources.md](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Resources.md) page.
4. For those unable to use git, create a github account, then fork the `Julia.jl` repo on the user interface. Then edit the page by [clicking on the "pencil" icon on the markdown page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), then click on save and submit a PR. Github does this [automatically in 8 steps](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).
