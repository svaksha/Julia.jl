# INDEX
For Base packages, check if the package you seek is listed in the [built-in package manager](https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl) on github, or check METADATA for [registered Julia packages](http://pkg.julialang.org/), then use the built-in package manager to install it after checking the requirements for respective versions and dont forget the Easter eggs! 
For package creators, here is a [sample Julia package](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl) model. The latest interesting package statistics are available at the [Julia Package Ecosystem Pulse](http://pkg.julialang.org/pulse.html) webpage which mirrors the current core development on [github](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pulse).

**DISCLAIMER :** As a new language in the scientific computing scene it is frequently in a state of flux due to the addition of new libraries, resulting in frequent changes and page reordering. Since the **Julia.jl** repo only provides a list (of links) of Julia packages out in the wild, it should not be considered an endorsment of any particular package for software quality, technical features, coding style/organization, etc...

# CONTRIBUTE
[Contributions](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/graphs/contributors) to `Julia.jl` are welcome in the form of pull requests (PR). Here are some guidelines and tips on how to submit a Bug Report (BR) and/or [PR](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/pulls):

## Guidelines
The Julia community has [ethical guidelines](http://julialang.org/community/standards/) aimed at respecting Copyright, Licenses and attribution standards<sup>{1} and {2}</sup> which you are requested to follow while submitting materials to be listed. Additionally, if you find any material (or code repos) that violates these ethical standards, please file a bug report for their removal from `Julia.jl`.
+ References :
   + {1} https://github.com/JuliaLang/julialang.github.com/issues/200
   + {2} https://github.com/JuliaLang/julialang.github.com/issues/194

## BugReport-PullRequest
1. Add your link as per the top-level Category page within the topic sub-section(s), in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) in the markdown files.
2. For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report (BR), or make the necessary changes and submit a PR. Both are welcome. Please submit separate PR's for each link or change added.
3. For Documentation and cookbooks, check if it matches the categories listed, else, list it on the [Resources.md](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Resources.md) page.
4. For those unable to use git, create a github account, then fork the `Julia.jl` repo on the user interface. Then edit the page by [clicking on the "pencil" icon on the markdown page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), then click on save and submit a PR. Github does this [automatically in 8 steps](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).
