== Bioinformatics, Biotech ==
* [https://github.com/forio/GeneticAlgorithms.jl GeneticAlgorithms.jl] is a lightweight framework that simplifies the process of creating genetic algorithms and running them in parallel.
* Circuitscape.jl:: A [https://github.com/tanmaykm/Circuitscape.jl Julia implementation] of the [http://www.circuitscape.org/ Circuitscape] lib in Python, that uses electronic circuit theory to solve problems in landscape ecology.


== Bloom Filters ==
* [https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/BloomFilters.jl Bloom filters] are a probabilistic data structure that can be used to test the inclusion and exclusion of items in a list.


== Clustering algorithms ==
* Clustering.jl:: Basic functions for [https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/Clustering.jl [clustering data: k-means, dp-means], etc..


== Machine Learning, Data Mining ==
* [https://github.com/bensadeghi/DecisionTree.jl Decision Tree]
* The [https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/kNN.jl K-nearest neighbors] algorithm in Julia.


== NLP ==
* Julia package for [https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/TextAnalysis.jl text analysis].
* The [https://github.com/lindahua/DataStructures.jl DataStructures.jl] package also has Peter Norvig's spelling corrector ported to Julia as a default dictionary implementation.
* [https://github.com/iamed2/PyLexYacc.jl PyLexYacc.jl], an interface to Python Lex-Yacc package that uses reflection for most of its processing. 


== Nonlinear Optimization ==
* NLopt.jl:: Package to call the [https://github.com/JuliaOpt/NLopt.jl NLopt nonlinear-optimization library] from the Julia language.
